## Overview

This guide provides instructions for using the Nix troubleshooting kit and benchmarking tools with Quarto integration.

## Available Downloads

The following resources are available:

- **Nix troubleshooting kit** (with CI workflow & scripts): `nix-troubleshooting-kit.zip`
- **Benchmarks kit** (Python, R, Rust + Makefile): `benchmarks.zip`  
- **Quarto partial** for rendering benchmark results: `benchmarks-partial.qmd`

## Using the Quarto Partial

### Step 1: Run Benchmarks

Navigate to the benchmarks directory and collect JSON lines data:

```bash
cd benchmarks
# Set your environment variables first
export AZURE_*="your_azure_values"
export DATABRICKS_*="your_databricks_values"
make all  # appends JSON to bench_results.jsonl
```

### Step 2: Include in Quarto Document

	2.	In your main Quarto doc, include the partial and point it to your results file:

params:
  results_path: bench_results.jsonl

{{< include "quarto/partials/benchmarks-partial.qmd" >}}

Or set an environment variable:

export BENCH_RESULTS_PATH="bench_results.jsonl"
quarto render your-doc.qmd

If you want this wired into your repo with paths adjusted to your structure, send me your intended folder layout and I’ll tailor the includes and Make targets. ￼
