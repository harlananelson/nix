How to use the Quarto partial
	1.	Run some benchmarks and collect JSON lines:

cd benchmarks
# set your AZURE_* and DATABRICKS_* env vars first
make all  # appends JSON to bench_results.jsonl

	2.	In your main Quarto doc, include the partial and point it to your results file:

params:
  results_path: bench_results.jsonl

{{< include "quarto/partials/benchmarks-partial.qmd" >}}

Or set an environment variable:

export BENCH_RESULTS_PATH="bench_results.jsonl"
quarto render your-doc.qmd

If you want this wired into your repo with paths adjusted to your structure, send me your intended folder layout and I’ll tailor the includes and Make targets. ￼
