## Overview

This guide provides a verified, production-safe method for making the **Positron IDE** reliably use an R environment provided by **Nix** during a **Remote-SSH** session. It is specifically for the Positron IDE, not standard VS Code.

This architecture solves common and subtle failure points discovered through extensive troubleshooting:
-   **IDE Rejection:** Positron's R Language Pack rejecting Nix's R wrapper due to missing validation markers.
-   **Environment Mismatch:** Positron starting the correct R binary but failing to load the Nix environment, resulting in missing packages and environment variables.
-   **Configuration Errors:** Failures from using `${workspaceFolder}` in settings and syntax conflicts within the `flake.nix` `shellHook`.

### The Solution
The final, verified strategy is to use a **project-local `.Renviron` file**. This file is automatically generated by the `flake.nix` `shellHook` every time you enter the environment. When Positron starts an R session in your project directory, R automatically reads this file, correctly setting up its own library paths and environment variables.

### Outcomes
-   A flake-based dev shell with R, Python, and all necessary dependencies.
-   A `.Renviron` file that makes the Nix environment available to Positron R sessions.
-   A stable, project-local symlink to the R binary for easy configuration.
-   A comprehensive troubleshooting guide for Positron-specific issues.

## 1. Directory Layout
Replace placeholders like `/path/to/projects` and `<your-username>` with your own values.

```text
/path/to/projects/
├─ my-local-package/         # Optional: A local R package (as a git repo)
└─ my-project/               # The main project directory
   ├─ flake.nix             # The heart of the Nix environment
   ├─ .envrc                # For automatic activation with direnv
   └─ .vscode/
      └─ settings.json       # Positron settings (scoped to the remote host)
````

## 2\. `flake.nix`

This is the most critical file. It defines all dependencies and contains the `shellHook` that generates the `.Renviron` file.

```nix
{
  description = "A reproducible R and Python environment for Positron";

  inputs = {
    # Pinning to a stable channel is recommended for production.
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-24.05";
    # Example for a local package dependency.
    # my-local-package.url = "git+file:///path/to/projects/my-local-package";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, ... }@inputs:
    let
      system = builtins.currentSystem or "x86_64-linux";
      pkgs = import nixpkgs {
        inherit system;
        config.allowUnfree = true;
      };

      # Define your R environment with all packages.
      # IRkernel is included for optional Jupyter notebook support.
      wrappedR = pkgs.rWrapper.override {
        packages = with pkgs.rPackages; [
          tidyverse
          arrow
          odbc
          DBI
          IRkernel
          # Add other required R packages here...
          # And your local package if you have one:
          # myLocalPackage
        ];
      };

    in {
      devShells.${system}.default = pkgs.mkShell {
        buildInputs = with pkgs; [
          wrappedR
          (python3.withPackages (ps: [ ps.pandas ps.ipykernel ps.jupyterlab ]))
          unixODBC 
          unixODBCDrivers.msodbcsql18 # Example ODBC driver
          glibcLocales
        ];

        shellHook = ''
          # --- Basic Environment Setup ---
          export LANG="en_US.UTF-8"
          unset LD_PRELOAD # Prevents SIGABRT crashes in IDE sessions

          # --- Create a stable, project-local symlink to R ---
          # Positron will point to this file.
          mkdir -p .nix-bin
          ln -sf "$(which R)" .nix-bin/R

          # --- The Core Solution: Generate a project-local .Renviron file ---
          # This injects the Nix environment into the R session started by Positron.
          # The '--vanilla' flag is CRITICAL to prevent R from reading a stale/corrupted
          # .Renviron file while trying to generate a new one, which causes a loop.
          R_LIBS_SITE_VALUE=$(${wrappedR}/bin/R --vanilla -q --slave -e 'cat(Sys.getenv("R_LIBS_SITE"))')
          
          # The ''${...} syntax is a Nix-specific escape to ensure the shell,
          # not Nix, expands the R_LIBS_SITE_VALUE variable.
          cat > .Renviron <<EOF
R_LIBS_SITE=''${R_LIBS_SITE_VALUE}
ODBCSYSINI=$(pwd)/.odbc
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
EOF
          # Explicitly ensure LD_PRELOAD remains unset within the R session.
          echo "LD_PRELOAD=" >> .Renviron

          echo "✅ Project environment ready (with .Renviron for Positron)"
        '';
      };
    };
}
```

## 3\. `.envrc`

Create this file in your project root to enable automatic environment activation with `direnv`.

```bash
use flake --impure
```

After creating it, run `direnv allow` in your terminal.

-----

## 4\. `settings.json`

This file configures Positron for your project. **Crucially, it uses a hardcoded absolute path**, as Positron's R Language Pack does not reliably expand the `${workspaceFolder}` variable.

Create this file at `.vscode/settings.json` inside your project directory. **Remember to replace the placeholder path.**

```json
{
  "positron.r.interpreters.default": "/path/to/projects/my-project/.nix-bin/R",
  "positron.r.interpreters.startupBehavior": "manual",
  "positron.r.kernel.logLevel": "debug"
}
```

-----

## 5\. Final Setup and Test

1.  **Initialize the Environment:** Navigate to your project directory and run `nix develop` once. This will execute the `shellHook`, create the `.Renviron` file, and set up the `.nix-bin/R` symlink.
2.  **Clean Restart (Mandatory):**
      * On the remote server, kill any lingering Positron processes: `pkill -f .positron-server || true`
      * On your local machine, **completely quit** the Positron IDE (`File > Exit`).
3.  **Test in Positron:**
      * Restart Positron and connect to your remote server.
      * Open your project folder.
      * Open an R file or start the R console. It should now use your Nix-provided R.
      * Verify by running `.libPaths()` (it should show many `/nix/store` paths) and `library(tidyverse)` (it should load successfully).

## 6\. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Diagnosis | Solution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| R session starts, but `library()` fails with "package not found". | The `.Renviron` file is missing, corrupted, or not being read. | Verify the `shellHook` in your `flake.nix` is correct. Delete the old `.Renviron` (`rm .Renviron`) and re-run `nix develop`. |
| Positron log shows `... is not absolute...ignoring`. | You are using `${workspaceFolder}` in your `settings.json`. Positron's R Language Pack does not expand this variable. | **Replace `${workspaceFolder}` with the hardcoded, absolute path** to your project's `.nix-bin/R` file. |
| `nix develop` fails with an "undefined variable" error. | The `shellHook` has a syntax error. Nix is interpreting a shell variable `${...}` as a Nix variable. | Use the Nix-specific escape syntax: `''${...}`. For example, `R_LIBS_SITE=''${R_LIBS_SITE_VALUE}`. |
| The `.Renviron` file is full of the R startup banner text. | The R command in the `shellHook` is running in interactive mode and its output is polluting the file. | Add the `--vanilla -q --slave` flags to the R command in your `shellHook` to make it run silently. |
| Positron shows no R interpreters at all. | Your `settings.json` path is incorrect, or the `.nix-bin/R` file does not exist or is not executable. | Double-check the absolute path in `settings.json`. Run `ls -l .nix-bin/R` to ensure the symlink exists. Run `nix develop` to regenerate it. |
