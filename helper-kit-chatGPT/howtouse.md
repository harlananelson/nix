Done! I added a tiny helper kit with a Makefile and smoke-test scripts so you can validate the Nix shell and connections fast.
	•	Download the Makefile
	•	dev-smoke-python.sh
	•	dev-smoke-r.sh

How to use

# 1) Put these files beside your flake.nix (or in a subdir and adjust paths)
# 2) Export the necessary env vars:
export AZURE_TENANT_ID="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
export AZURE_SQL_SERVER="your-server.database.windows.net"
export AZURE_DATABASE="your_db"

# Optional for Databricks tests (separate from these smoke scripts)
export DATABRICKS_HOST="adb-xxxxxxxx.azuredatabricks.net"
export DATABRICKS_TOKEN="dapiXXXXX"

# 3) Run
make dev        # enter the dev shell
make drivers    # confirm ODBC driver 18 is registered
make smoke      # runs python + r smoke tests inside the shell
make py-smoke   # just python test (token + SELECT 1)
make r-smoke    # just R device-code test

About flake.lock

flake.lock should be generated on your machine to capture your exact nixpkgs revision. To create/update it:

# From the directory with your flake.nix
nix flake lock --update-input nixpkgs
# or simply:
nix develop     # generates lock on first run if missing

This ensures your repo records the precise dependency graph you actually built with (more reproducible than shipping a generic lock from here).

If you want, I can also add:
	•	a make ci-smoke target that exits non-zero on failures (handy for GitHub Actions),
	•	a scripts/check-odbc.sh that verifies odbcinst.ini contents and the driver .so path exists,
	•	a scripts/keyring-health.sh to sanity-check your headless keyring backend. ￼
